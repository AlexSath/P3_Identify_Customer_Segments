## Overview:
This project was to group German population data provided by the company Arvato using KMeans from it's principal components. These groups were then used to group a similar set of data, but this time from Udacity customers. Udacity customer metrics were then compared and discussed to the overall population data.
'Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb' was the medium through which all of the code was executed. 'Identify_Customer_Segments.html' is an HTML version of the same file that is quite a bit easier to read.
